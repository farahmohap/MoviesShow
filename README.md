# movies_show

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
## Merge Conflict Resolution - Search Bar

**Conflict Points:**
- Constructor parameters (callback vs controller)
- Layout structure (icon position)
- Visual styling (height, padding, shadow)

**Resolution:**
1. Kept both callback and controller parameters
2. Used the left-aligned icon layout from develop
3. Combined styling improvements from both branches:
   - Height from main
   - Box shadow from develop
   - Opacity from main
4. Used the more descriptive hint text from main
